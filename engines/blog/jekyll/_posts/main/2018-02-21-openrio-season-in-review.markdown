2018 was a great season for OpenRIO. On our main project, [GradleRIO](http://github.com/Open-RIO/GradleRIO), there have been **251 teams** and **1427 unique users** from 7 countries, with **52.9 thousand total builds** since January 1st, 2018. Let's take a deeper look at the numbers...

## Privacy and Data Integrity
OpenRIO takes your data seriously. We don't sell it, we don't make it public.

Data is only collected if you haven't disabled telemetry (above), and if you have an internet connection. **If you're connected to a robot, the report is not recorded, and so those numbers don't count towards the totals in this post**.

Data in this post has not been manipulated. Countries/States/Provinces have been cross-referenced with The Blue Alliance.

## The 2018 Timeline

Build counts have skyrocketed since Kickoff, and are especially popular on Saturdays. Builds become more common in the later weeks (6/7) than in the rest of the season, with Week 5 having the biggest peak at 2652 builds in a single day.

## The OS Demographic

About 50% of users appear to be using Windows 10, followed by 23% using Linux, 17% using Mac OS X, and the remaining using other versions of Windows.

## Region Statistics

By cross-referencing team numbers with [The Blue Alliance](http://thebluealliance.com), we can give a geographic breakdown of GradleRIO usage. Build count is indicated by the darkness of the color shade, and team count by the number on each state.

California holds the record in both regards, with 33 teams and 9532 builds since January 1st.
